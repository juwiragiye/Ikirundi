# Ikirundi Corpus Project: Building Foundations for Kirundi Natural Language Processing Tasks

> The Ikirundi Corpus Project aims to create a comprehensive collection of Kirundi language resources to support and facilitate a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This project addresses the challenges of working with a low-resource language by curating a high-quality parallel corpus for various tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, and named-entity recognition, and making these resources publicly available for researchers, educators, and developers. Our mission is to expand the accessibility of the Kirundi language in the field of NLP and contribute to the development of language technologies that serve the diverse needs of the Kirundi-speaking community.
